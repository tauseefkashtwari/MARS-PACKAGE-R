# MARS regression 

•	Built a R package, including a description and namespace file, in a team of 3 to implement Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). 

•	Programmed functions (pseudocode) in R, such as forward stepwise, as part of the MARS algorithm.

•	Tested functions, including developed standard methods (print, plot, and summary) for MARS object, using the cars data.   

•	Designed vignettes to document functional requirements of the package and function calls on data for better user understanding.
